## About üìñ
DoggieSitter is committed to providing a reliable care option for your furry friend while you're busy at work, school, or other activities. We understand that you lead a busy life, and we're here to ensure that your dogs are well taken care of in your absence.
<br>
Through DoggieSitter, dog owners are connected with dog sitters by region. While you're away at work or running errands, you can rest assured that your dog will be in good hands and not left alone at home. Our main aim is to provide a service that allows dog owners to continue with their day-to-day lives, with peace of mind about their dogs' care and safety.
